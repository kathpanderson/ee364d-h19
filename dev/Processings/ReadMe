# Main for processing of SPM Data
# May need reformating based on GUI calling structure
# First positions are assigned based on the timestamp of the measurment
# Next The FFT of each time series is taken
# A threshold is then taken to statistically eliminate data points likely to be noise
# The remaining points are clustered in each frequency using meanshift
# The clusters are then visualized with access to the GUI
# Inputs:	SNR for Photdetector #1, Photdetector #2, Current #1, Current #2, Tip Bias
#			number of X pixels, and number of Y pixels
#			Positions.csv
#			RawData.csv
# Outputs:	TimeSpaceData.csv
#			ProcessedData.csv
#			ProcessedData.mp4
