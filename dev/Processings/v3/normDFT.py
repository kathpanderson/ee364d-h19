# plot of normalized fourier of data with hight normalized by:
# 1. points in DFT
# 2. maximum frequency component as logrithmic refrence
# 3. normalized frequency by sampling rate
# 4. only include half the DFT that has the amplitude information
#inputs: time domain data
#outputs: normalized DFT of input and normalized frequency as well
